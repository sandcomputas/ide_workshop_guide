# The Software Developer's Toolbox

As a software developer there are a lot of useful tools that will make your lives easier and your code better. In this workshop we will take a look at some of the tools and tricks we find most helpful in our IDE. IDE's are different, but all of the most popular ones will have most of the tools we will cover here. We prefer the IDEs developed by JetBrains, they look quite similar, but have specific editors depending on the language/framework you are dealing with:

- PyCharm - Python
- Intellij - mainly for Java, but support other languages as well.
- Webstrom - Javascript / HTML / CSS
- Rider - .NET
- ... and many more
